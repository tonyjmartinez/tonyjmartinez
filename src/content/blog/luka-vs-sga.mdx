Every season, the MVP conversation starts in October and gets louder until someone
inevitably wins it in June. But the 2023-24 race felt different. Two players — Luka
Dončić and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander — spent the entire year trading blows in the box
score, leading franchises that had no business being as good as they were, and doing it
in ways that defied easy comparison.

The raw numbers tell one story. The *context* of those numbers tells another.

## Luka's season in numbers

The Mavericks are a playoff team because Luka Dončić wills them into one every year.
That's not hyperbole — Dallas's offense ranks in the top five when he's on the floor and
craters to bottom-five when he's not. His 33.9 points per game led the league, but
the scoring average undersells how he creates offense: he averaged nearly 10 assists while
also pulling down 9.2 rebounds, making him one of the few players in history to average
30-9-9 over a full season.

  player="Luka Dončić"
  season="2023-24"
  color="#00538C"
  stats={[
    { label: "PPG", value: 33.9, max: 45 },
    { label: "RPG", value: 9.2, max: 15 },
    { label: "APG", value: 9.8, max: 15 },
    { label: "FG%", value: 49.6, max: 70 },
    { label: "TS%", value: 61.6, max: 75 },
  ]}
/>

What stands out most is the efficiency. A player averaging that kind of volume at 49.6%
from the field and a 61.6% true shooting percentage isn't just good — it's historically
rare. You can count on one hand the players who've averaged 30+ points per game at that
efficiency level.

## SGA's case

Here's the thing: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's season deserved more attention than it got.
Oklahoma City was supposed to be a young, developing team. A playoff bubble squad at best.
Instead they ran away with the Western Conference's best record — and SGA was the engine.

<NBAStatGrid
  client:visible
  player="Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"
  season="2023-24"
  color="#007AC1"
  stats={[
    { label: "PPG", value: 30.1, max: 45 },
    { label: "RPG", value: 5.5, max: 15 },
    { label: "APG", value: 6.4, max: 15 },
    { label: "FG%", value: 53.5, max: 70 },
    { label: "TS%", value: 64.0, max: 75 },
  ]}
/>

The field goal and true shooting percentages are the argument. SGA shot nearly four
percentage points better from the field than Luka on comparable volume. He also added
more steals (2.0 per game, leading the league) while doing it for the best team in the
West. That's the MVP case in two sentences.

<Aside type="info" title="On efficiency vs. volume">
  True shooting percentage (TS%) accounts for the different point values of two-pointers,
  three-pointers, and free throws. It's the cleanest single-number measure of scoring
  efficiency. SGA's 64.0% would rank among the best ever for a volume scorer.
</Aside>

## Head to head

Put them side by side and the tradeoffs come into focus. Luka does more — much more —
in terms of playmaking and rebounding. SGA does his scoring more efficiently and plays
better defense. Neither answer is obviously correct.

<NBAComparison
  client:visible
  playerA={{
    name: "Luka Dončić",
    color: "#00538C",
    stats: { PPG: 33.9, RPG: 9.2, APG: 9.8, "TS%": 61.6 },
  }}
  playerB={{
    name: "SGA",
    color: "#007AC1",
    stats: { PPG: 30.1, RPG: 5.5, APG: 6.4, "TS%": 64.0 },
  }}
  stats={["PPG", "RPG", "APG", "TS%"]}
/>

The comparison makes the efficiency gap visible in a way the box score doesn't. Luka's
bars are longer on counting stats. SGA's bars are longer where it counts most for a
scorer: shooting percentage.

## So who was better?

Depends on what you value. If you believe the MVP award should go to the player who does
the most — the player whose team genuinely wouldn't function without him — it's Luka.
His usage, his playmaking, his rebounding all point to a player who is essentially a
one-man offense.

If you believe the award should go to the player who did their job most efficiently
for the team with the best record, it's SGA.

Both are correct framings. That's what makes this race worth arguing about.
