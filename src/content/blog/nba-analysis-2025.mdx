# NBA Season Analysis: Top Scorers Compared

The 2024-25 NBA season has been one of the most competitive in recent memory. Let's break down how the league's top scorers compare across key statistical categories.

## Points Per Game

The scoring race this season has been incredibly tight, with several players averaging over 30 points per game.

## What the Numbers Tell Us

Looking at the data above, a few things stand out:

1. **Efficiency matters** — raw scoring numbers don't tell the full story. Some players achieve their numbers on fewer shot attempts, making them more efficient scorers.

2. **Three-point shooting** has become even more important. The top scorers who also shoot well from beyond the arc create incredible spacing for their teams.

3. **Free throw attempts** continue to be a differentiator. Players who get to the line frequently tend to have more consistent scoring outputs across games.

## Looking Ahead

As the season progresses into the playoff stretch, it'll be interesting to see how these numbers shift. Historically, the top playoff performers tend to elevate their scoring while maintaining or improving efficiency.

I'll update this analysis as the season continues. Stay tuned for more breakdowns!
