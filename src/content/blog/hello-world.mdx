# Hello World

Welcome to my new portfolio site! I built this from scratch using **Astro** with **MDX** for content, **React** for interactive components, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. It's deployed as a fully static site on **Cloudflare Pages**.

## Why Astro?

After years of working with various frameworks, Astro's approach clicked with me immediately:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** — pages ship as pure HTML unless I explicitly opt in
- **Islands architecture** — interactive components hydrate independently, only when needed
- **Native MDX support** — first-class integration for mixing Markdown with components
- **Vite-powered dev server** — sub-second hot reload during development

## The MDX Advantage

MDX lets me write content in Markdown while embedding custom React components. For example, I can include interactive data visualizations directly in blog posts — check out my [NBA analysis post](/blog/nba-analysis-2025) for an example.

Here's what a typical MDX file looks like:

```mdx
---
title: "My Post"
pubDate: 2025-12-01
tags: ["example"]
---
import NbaChart from '../../components/interactive/NbaChart.tsx';

# My Post

Some prose here, then an interactive chart:

<NbaChart client:visible players={["Player A", "Player B"]} stat="ppg" />
```

## Performance First

Since every page is pre-rendered at build time, the site loads fast — no server-side rendering, no cold starts, just static files served from Cloudflare's edge network. Interactive React components only ship JavaScript for the specific islands that need it.

## What's Next

I'll be writing about **software engineering**, **NBA analytics**, and other topics that interest me. Stay tuned!
